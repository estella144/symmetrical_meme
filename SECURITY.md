## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!---
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
--->

To report a vulnerability, submit an issue and add the red "security" tag to it.
We will respond in a few days. If the vulnerability is accepted,
it means that we have committed to fixing the vulnerability.
If it is rejected, it means that we have decided to not action the vulnerability.
